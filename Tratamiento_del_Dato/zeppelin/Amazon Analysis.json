I'd classify it as a younger-modeller or beginner's set in that the detailing isn't as fine as Hornby's more expensive models\t e.g. Bachmann.The track is pretty good quality\t and without one you'll run into problems like some of the other reviewers.The real problem I have is that the coupling on the rear of the tender that connects it to the carriages is ridiculously flimsy; it's held in place by a tiny thread of unsupported soft plastic; after about ten light uses of the set it's already nearly snapped off and can no longer support its own weight.I purchased this as a project to build with my young son and with memories of the Hornby set I had as a boy.
