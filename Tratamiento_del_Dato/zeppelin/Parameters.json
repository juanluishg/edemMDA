The upside is that the hobby brought out the 'mechanic' in him and that has been amazing to watch.Regular maintenance after every few hours of run time includes break-down\t clean and refill of the shocks\t and he has tested many different weight shock oils and different strength springs over the years. He is tough on these cars and has built several jumps\t so he need the shocks\t shock coils and shock oil to really stand up to the punishment. For the last year or so\t Losi shock oils have become his favorite as their oils just seems to stand up well for a longer period of time.Depending on weather conditions and the type of running he is planning to do (off-road\t pavement speed runs\t dirt track racing...)\t our son will use different weight shock oils in the car... but his most frequently used oils are 40\t 45 and 50 weight. Since he cleans the shock regularly\t we typically purchase the larger 4 ounce bottles instead of smaller ones.If you are looking for a good remote control car or truck shock oil\t for uses as I have described above\t then our son totally recommends that you give Losi Shock Oil a try based on his experience with it. Highly recommended\t especially in these more economically priced larger bottles.Go for it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"TTM-Funktionsmodellbau\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£7.64\"\"}\n on 24 Feb. 2015 // good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£8.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£8.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"trainmad\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£7.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£28.63\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 11 April 2015 // He loved it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Modelsales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"BuySend\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£15.79\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£37.69\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 21 Jan. 2016 // top toy\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.94\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"GiftLocalUK\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.96\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Sell 24x7\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.07\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Fun Fuzion\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£10.38\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Life Unearthed\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£14.31\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Venture Blue\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£14.47\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Mini Model Shop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£12.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£16.31\"\"}\n on 1 Mar. 2015 // well pleased with item and service many thanks\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£12.64\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£12.72\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£12.77\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£11.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"DVDCineShop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.34\"\"}\n on 1 Jan. 2015 // Very good had to return due to ordering wrong scale\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£6.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£6.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£24.11\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 17 Sept. 2014 // verygood\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£52.97\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Frome Models Centre\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£52.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"tablet_books\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£85.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£114.59\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"japazon\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£123.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Sam Store US\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£300.25\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 23 Sept. 2014 // have not finished the decals and colors yet but it is good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£10.48\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£10.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£10.56\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£11.22\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.39\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£9.14\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"McKeeman Models\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\n on 4 Oct. 2014 // Dispatched quickly and just as advertised…a brand new model kit in a sealed box.

It is presented in a great decorative wooden box which looks exactly like an enormous die!The game is a bit like a a dice version of Poker - but the bluffing aspect is even more fundamental; hence the name liar's dice. Each player rolls the dice and then they have to make a claim as what hand they have e.g. 'three fours' or 'a high straight (2-3-4-5-6). The next player can then either call their bluff by asserting that they lied or else roll the dice and make a claim for a better hand for themselves. Liars who are found out have to contribute a counter to the pot.And so it goes on with many an accusation and much finger pointing. Really skilful people learn to pull an annoyingly condescending look of innocence which tempts the others to accuse them of lying just to stop them being so irritating!Eventually this leads either to a winner or to fisticuffs but either way great fun will be had by all.2-4 players.

Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This locomotive is suitable with analogue train layouts only and is not DCC compatible.

Originally numbered as LNER 2595, Trigo was the eleventh of twenty-seven A3s to be built as an A3, the other fifty-one were A1s that were later converted to A3s. All the A1 and A3 Class locomotives were named after famous race horses. Trigo was an Irish born race horse who won the Epsom Derby in 1929 making the horse famous and inspiring the LNE R to name one of their new locomotives after him. Trigo is modelled here as British Rail (BR) 60084 in BR blue from the era of June 1949 to August 1952, during this period Trigo pulled a Streamline type tender and was based at the Neville Hill shed in Leeds.

The stunning Hornby train set features a Power driving unit\t dummy driving unit and two passenger saloons. The model includes flush glazing\t detailed roof panels and simulated pantographs. The track circuit sits easily on the 1600 x 1180 MidiMat and by adding Hornby Track and Building packs can soon be developed into a very effective model railway layout.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallard’s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike the Mallard’s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s, Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the ‘A4 Preservation Society’, later known as ‘The A4 Locomotive Society Ltd’ and now ‘The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd’. ‘The A4 Locomotive Society’ has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust. The Trust is committed to keeping the locomotive operating and running special excursions on both the main line and heritage railways such as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it is based.This is an accurate, detailed scale model in die cast presented in a perspex display case mounted on a plinth.

The striking apple green liveried class A1 \"\"Flying Scotsman\"\" helps to recreate those wonderful days of train travel in the 1930s when the two great railway rivals\t LNER and the LMS\t vied for the lucrative passenger traffic between London and Scotland. The Flying Scotsman The train includes a 4-6-2 \"\"Flying Scotsman\"\" locomotive\t two composite coaches\t and a brake coach. It is operated using the R8250 train controller provided. Additional coaches can be obtained to extend the train. R1167 set track The track circuit sits easily on the 1600 x 1180 mm MidiMat included\t and by adding Hornby track and accessory packs it can soon be developed into a very effective model railway layout. Extend your set in easy steps by adding track packs and TrakMat accessory packs all the way to the full layout pictured on your MidiMat. Fill out your MidiMat with additional track and building packs The track circuit in this set can be extended to fully complete the included MidiMat which\t with additional Hornby track and building packs\n on 3 Nov. 2012 // This is one of the most popular trains in the world and Hornby has produced a very good model which looks like the real machine.Before I purchased this train set\t I did some research and found that there are several versions of the Flying Scotsman train set.The versions are:-1) Flying Scotsman train set which includes two coaches\t oval and track pack A.2) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches\t oval and track pack A.3) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches\t oval with track pack A and B.As I already have the Eurostar train set with Track packs A\tB\tC and D I decided to buy No.2. I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set\t and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail\t you can see into the windows\t each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one\t and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost\t I would not let young children play with it on their own\t but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more › | Mostly a great set; but not a toy; and ruined by one fundamental design flaw // 1.0 // 24 Nov. 2013 // By\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\nc1976e03a3a8f7acca6b75e0668a9ea7\tGaugemaster Twin Track Cased Controller\tGaugemaster\t£94.88\t2 new\t3\t6\t4.7 out of 5 stars\tHobbies > Model Trains & Railway Sets > Lighting & Signal Engineering > Control Moduls\thttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Peco-Shows-You-How-Booklet/dp/B002QVDLDE | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gaugemaster | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Peco-Cleaner-Abrasive-Rubber-Block/dp/B001BLPEX0 | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Peco-SL-310-Nickel-Joiners-Railway/dp/B001BHGCTE | http://www.amazon.co.uk/PN133-Gauge-Signal-Box-Set/dp/B008MXG646 | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Peco-SL-14-Track-suitable-Gauge/dp/B001BHLR4E\tGaugemaster Twin Track Cased Controller\tTechnical Details Manufacturer recommended age:14 years and up Manufacturer referenceGMD    Additional Information ASINB0063F1MXK Best Sellers Rank 126,056 in Toys & Games (See top 100) #4 in Toys & Games > Model Trains & Railway Sets > Lighting & Signal Engineering > Control Moduls Shipping Weight1.6 Kg Delivery Destinations:Visit the Delivery Destinations Help page to see where this item can be delivered.
